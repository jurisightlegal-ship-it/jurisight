# üîí Security Analysis - Environment Variables

## ‚úÖ Security Status: SECURE

All environment variables have been properly configured with appropriate security measures.

## üîç Environment Variable Analysis

### ‚úÖ SAFE TO EXPOSE (NEXT_PUBLIC_*)
These variables are **intentionally public** and safe to expose to the browser:

#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- **Purpose**: Supabase project URL
- **Security**: ‚úÖ Safe - This is meant to be public
- **Usage**: Client-side Supabase operations
- **Value**: `https://xxrajbmlbjlgihncivxi.supabase.co`

#### `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Purpose**: Supabase anonymous key for client-side operations
- **Security**: ‚úÖ Safe - Has limited permissions via RLS policies
- **Usage**: Client-side database queries with Row Level Security
- **Value**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` (JWT token)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SERVER-ONLY (No NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
These variables are **server-only** and should NEVER be exposed to the browser:

#### `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- **Purpose**: Full admin access to Supabase
- **Security**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL** - Server-only, never expose to browser
- **Usage**: Admin operations, bypassing RLS policies
- **Protection**: Only used in API routes and server-side code

#### `DATABASE_URL`
- **Purpose**: Direct database connection string
- **Security**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL** - Contains database credentials
- **Usage**: Server-side database operations
- **Protection**: Only used in server-side code

#### `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- **Purpose**: JWT signing secret for NextAuth.js
- **Security**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL** - Server-only authentication secret
- **Usage**: Signing and verifying JWT tokens
- **Protection**: Only used in server-side authentication

#### `CRON_API_KEY`
- **Purpose**: API key for cron job authentication
- **Security**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT** - Server-only API key
- **Usage**: Authenticating scheduled tasks
- **Protection**: Only used in server-side cron operations

#### `APP_URL`
- **Purpose**: Application URL for server-side operations
- **Security**: ‚úÖ Safe - Just a URL, no sensitive data
- **Usage**: Server-side API calls and cron jobs
- **Protection**: Server-only, not exposed to browser

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures Implemented

### ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Database**: All tables have RLS policies enabled
- **Client Access**: Limited to what RLS policies allow
- **Admin Access**: Service role key bypasses RLS for admin operations

### ‚úÖ API Security
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with secure JWT handling
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Contributor)
- **API Keys**: Protected endpoints require proper authentication

### ‚úÖ Environment Variable Protection
- **Public Variables**: Only safe, intended-to-be-public variables use `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- **Server Variables**: Sensitive variables have no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- **Documentation**: Clear comments indicating security level of each variable

## üö® Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Implemented
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each variable has minimum required permissions
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Client vs server variables clearly separated
3. **Secure Defaults**: RLS policies restrict access by default
4. **Environment Isolation**: Different values for development vs production

### ‚úÖ Recommendations for Production
1. **Rotate Keys**: Regularly rotate `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `CRON_API_KEY`
2. **Monitor Access**: Set up logging for admin operations
3. **Backup Security**: Store sensitive keys in secure key management
4. **Regular Audits**: Review RLS policies and API permissions regularly

## üîê Deployment Security Checklist

### ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment
- [x] No sensitive variables use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- [x] RLS policies are properly configured
- [x] API endpoints require proper authentication
- [x] Service role key is server-only
- [x] Database credentials are server-only

### ‚úÖ Post-Deployment
- [ ] Verify environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Test that client cannot access server-only variables
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are working correctly
- [ ] Test admin-only endpoints are protected
- [ ] Monitor for any security warnings
